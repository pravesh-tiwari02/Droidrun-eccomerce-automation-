DroidRun E-commerce Price Comparison & Auto-Ordering Bot
🚀 Overview
This project is an Android automation system built using DroidRun that compares real-time product prices across Amazon, Flipkart, Blinkit, and Zepto, and automatically places an order on the cheapest platform.

The solution removes the need for manual price comparison and repetitive checkout actions, saving time and money for users.

🧩 Problem Statement
E-commerce prices vary across platforms due to dynamic pricing, delivery fees, and discounts. Users must manually check multiple apps, which is inefficient and error-prone. This leads to higher costs, missed deals, and poor user experience.

💡 Solution
Our system automates:

Price discovery across platforms
Total cost calculation
Cheapest platform selection
End-to-end order placement via Android UI automation
